# Project Workflow

## Overview
This project consists of two distinct but connected loops:

- **Loop A — Training & Active Learning**
  Uses an ensemble (“committee”) of diffusion models to measure uncertainty and
  select informative data for labeling.
  
- **Loop B — Generation & Physical Refinement**
  Uses a *single* trained diffusion model to generate molecular structures,
  followed by refinement using a learned force surrogate and optional physics
  oracle validation.

## Loop A: Training + Active Learning

**Goal:** Efficiently improve the diffusion model using uncertainty-driven data acquisition.

1️⃣ **Initial Labeled Subset**
- Begin with ~5–10% labeled MD frames.

2️⃣ **Train a Committee of Diffusion Models**
- 3–5 independently trained models.
- Models learn structural distribution.

3️⃣ **Uncertainty Estimation**
- Evaluate remaining unlabeled frames.
- Compute committee disagreement (uncertainty).

4️⃣ **Query Oracle**
- In the demo: “oracle” = hidden labels from existing dataset.
- In a real system: oracle could be MD simulation or expert input.

5️⃣ **Expand Training Pool**
- Add queried data to labeled set.

6️⃣ **Retrain / Update Models**
- Iterate and produce learning curves (coverage vs. #queries).

**Outcome:**  
A stronger, data-efficient diffusion model with demonstrated active-learning benefits.

## Loop B: Sampling + Guided Physical Refinement

**Goal:** Generate scientifically credible molecular structures.

1️⃣ **Final Generator Model**
- Use a *single trained diffusion model*
  - best performing model
  - or retrained model using all selected AL data

2️⃣ **Sample Candidate Structures**
- Generate conformations from the diffusion model.

3️⃣ **Optional Filtering**
- Remove obviously invalid geometries.

4️⃣ **Force-Surrogate Refinement**
- Apply short Langevin / gradient refinement using learned force predictor.
- Push samples toward lower-energy basins.

5️⃣ **Optional Physics Oracle Validation**
- Use LAMMPS or similar backend for minimization / verification.

6️⃣ **Evaluation**
- Compare φ/ψ densities
- Compare free-energy landscapes
- Evaluate basin coverage / clustering

**Outcome:**  
Physically plausible, diverse, and validated molecular structures.

## Key Clarifications

- **Committee is ONLY used in Loop A**  
  (uncertainty + active learning).

- **Loop B does NOT use uncertainty**  
  It uses a single trained generator + refinement.

- **Refined samples are NOT added back to training**  
  to avoid surrogate-induced bias.
